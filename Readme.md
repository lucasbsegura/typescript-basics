- It's the code used for a small presentation about the basics of typescript for Track & Trace 

## Notes about Typescript
- Is a programming language extending javascript
- Is a superset to JavaScript
- It extends JavaScript syntax with extra types (strong/static types)
- The core programming language is still JavaScript
- The base JavaScript doesn't change
- Adds features and static types to JavaScript 
- Code does not run in the browser
- Needs to by compiled to JavaScript (after compiled all the types will be removed)
- The compiled Typescript to JavaScript will run in the browser
